# Personal Blog

This is a personal blog project created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/).Here is the demo [link](https://nextjs-blog-neon.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

The `/admin` route is available to edit or add new blog posts. It is behind the Clerk authentication. Make sure you setup your account with [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/)

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
